Founded in 2013, Bellabeat is a successful small company, but they have the potential to become a larger player in the global smart device market.  Urska Srsen, cofounder and Chief Creative Officer of Bellabeat, believes that analyzing smart device fitness data could help unlock new growth opportunities for the company.\n\n### Task <a class=\"anchor\"  id=\"h3\"></a>\nAnalyze smart device usage data (FitBit) to gain insight into how consumers use non-Bellabeat smart devices.\n\n### Business Objectives <a class=\"anchor\"  id=\"h4\"></a>\n\n* What are some trends in smart device usage?\n* How could these trends apply to Bellabeat customers?\n* How could these trends help influence Bellabeat marketing strategy?\n\n# Data Source <a class=\"anchor\"  id=\"h5\"></a>\nThe dataset was generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03/12/2016 and 05/12/2016. Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring.\nThe data was downloaded from Kaggle [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/fitbit) and is in the Public Domain.\n\n### Data Storage & Integrity <a class=\"anchor\"  id=\"h6\"></a>\nThe data was downloaded and stored as csv files.  These files were primariliy looked at via excel. \n\nIn viewing the files, I found that there are 33 unique Ids in the Activity, Intensities, Steps, and Calories data frames (this is more than the original amount given of 30 users).  There are 24 users with data in the Sleep data frame, 9 of which have less than 10 sleep entries.  Any insights generated from the Sleep data frame may not be fully accurate becuase of this.  The weight data only has 8 users, 2 of whom have multiple entries.  The other six have 5 or less entries.  Therefore we cannot make accurate insights from the weight information.\n\n### Limitiations of Data <a class=\"anchor\"  id=\"h7\"></a>\n\n* There are only 30 respondents which is a very small subset of the number of people who use smart trackers.\n* The data is 7 years old. This may not be an accurate sampling of user activity anymore.\n* There are no demographics on the users.  Therefore we could have biased data and it may not represent a subset of the full population of users.\n* Not all of the files have the same amount of User Ids.  The Sleep data only has 8 users and therefore cannot be used for insights.\n\n","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"# Cleaning & Manipulation of Data <a class=\"anchor\"
